# BrainStation Capstone - Markers for Detecting Elderly Falls
=========================

### Executive Summary

Falls are a significant problem amongst senior citizens, negatively impacting their quality of life, causing significant health complications, and even leading to death. Society seems to accept this as the norm, but this project aims to highlight certain markers to prevent falls from ever happening and what seniors and their loved ones can do today to prevent falls. 
With predictive modelling, there is an opportunity to identify common variables that are indicators if a fall is likely to occur for an elderly.
The key takeaways from this project would be to identify which variables (physical activity, diet, or social connection), have a high correlation with an accident like a fall occurring.
